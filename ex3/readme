exporting symbols -
"core" kernel symbols will be found in /boot/System.Map.... file (core - as part of the kernel builtins)
while others will be found @ /proc/kallsyms

ex3a - exposing a function

ex3b & ex3c - exposing a function(b) and using it(c)
you can also load it with "modprobe"
but u need to create a simlink 
``` sudo ln -s ${PWD}/<module>.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/misc/ ```
refresh dependency with 
```sudo depmod -a```
and now you can load the module e.g:
```sudo modprobe ex3c```
